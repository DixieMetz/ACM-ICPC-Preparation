This curriculum has been developed to learn Algorithms to use in Competitive Programming, **but can also be used for:**
  - Practicing for Interviews
  - Improving Algorithmic Thinking
  - Practicing for College Classes

**Prerequisites:** 
  - To know at least one programming language. (_You have to be able to use the language efficiently._)

The concept of this repository is to have well-structured content divided into parts that one can follow even if they are busy. Here we collected sources we find well prepared to learn the proposed topics. The curriculum has different data structures and algorithms. 

**Estimated time required for a week is 6-7 hours.** (To complete the curriculum in the given time)

**Basic usage guide:**
Using this repository depends on what the user wants to do with it. Here we are suggesting the following for people who want to slowly gain knowledge of the topics while continuing their studies etc.:
  1. Check out the written or video sources provided for a given topic depending on the preference. Go over as many as needed to gain a good understanding of the topic.
  2. Without checking the source code, try to replicate the algorithm or data structure on your own.
  3. When stuck or when done, look at the source codes provided, and compare them with yours to see what might be your mistake. Try to fix it.
  4. After you feel comfortable with the code, try to solve the given problems.
  5. When you are done with solving or are stuck at some point, check given solutions and try to understand your mistake or see if a better approach exists.
